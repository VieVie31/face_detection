# Face Detection

This repository deals with some stuffs about face detection...

## Requirements

It requires python 2.7 with the following modules :

```
cv2        --> opencv
numpy      --> numerical computation
skimage    --> for computing lbp efficiently
sklearn    --> for machine learning
matplotlib --> for plotting and visualizing
```

## Files

### tools.py

Some usefull functions

## lbp_face_detection_model_training.py

Train a Logistic Regression model to learn to detect faces using the lbp features...
At the end of the training the model is saved as logistic_model.mdl with help th the pickle module...
